      <h2>Sport at Bristol</h2>
      <h4><strong>BUCS:</strong> Bristol is currently ranked third in the British University & College Sports league table! One of the reasons for Bristol's high scoring position is the sheer number of clubs that take part to represent the university. No matter what you're interested in, there will definitely be a sport society for you!</h4>
      <h4><strong>Competitive Sport:</strong> Many of our sports teams play at an extremely high level, competing with non-university teams on the weekend. If you are interested in continuing a sport that you have excelled at before joining the university then please contact the relevant club captain to see what Bristol can do to support you!</h4>
